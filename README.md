# Aircraft Noise Model

**_SUTD 2019 10.004 Advanced Mathematics II 1D Project (19F07 Group 9)_**

## Repository Details

We collected some survey data to build a mathematical equation relating the noise level (due to aircrafts) to the amount of study hours and productivity for studies of university students in Singapore.

We utilised Seaborn to graph the violin plot, Excel to draw the 3D graphs and LaTeX to create the report.

Our report is available [here](./10.004_1D_2019_Group_9.pdf) and our survey data is available [here](./responses.xlsx).

A clean version of the question paper is also available [here](./question.pdf).
